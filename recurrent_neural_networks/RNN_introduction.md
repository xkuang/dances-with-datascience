# Recurrent Neural Networks
## Introduction

### Sequences of Vectors
"The core reason that recurrent nets are more exciting is that they allow us to operate over sequences of vectors: Sequences in the input, the output, or in the most general case both." Andrej Karpathy [link](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)
